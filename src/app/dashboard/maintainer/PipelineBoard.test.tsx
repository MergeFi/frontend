/**
 * Tests for PipelineBoard (#88).
 *
 * The pipeline board previously had no column for "merged" (payout-pending)
 * bounties, silently dropping them from the board even though the page's
 * own "Value locked in escrow" stat still counted them. Extracted from the
 * async MaintainerDashboardPage into a plain function of already-fetched
 * bounties so it's directly testable without mocking data-fetching.
