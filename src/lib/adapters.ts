/**
 * Investigation notes for #86 (bounty-to-milestone cross-linking):
 *
 * - milestoneId was declared on the Bounty type but never set here — every
 *   Bounty this app constructed from live data had it permanently
 *   undefined. Fixed above by reading it from raw.issue.milestoneId, the
 *   shape confirmed against mergefi-backend's actual entities (there is no
 *   milestoneId on Bounty itself).
 * - Full field-by-field audit of Bounty vs. this function's return object
 *   (see adapters.test.ts's "field coverage" test) found milestoneId was
 *   the *only* field with this silent-drop bug; every other field,
 *   including the structurally-similar escrowId, was already mapped.
 * - Separately discovered while tracing this: mergefi-backend's
 *   `BountiesService.list()`/`findOne()` load bounties with no `relations`
 *   option at all, so `raw.issue`/`raw.claimedBy`/`raw.team` — and now
 *   `raw.issue.milestoneId` — are likely `undefined` on every live
 *   response today regardless of this fix, until that's corrected on the
 *   backend. Out of scope here (a different repo, and a much larger
 *   pre-existing gap than this issue's), but worth flagging since it
 *   affects whether this fix does anything observable yet in production.
 * - UI usage recommendation (#86 asks this be investigated, not
 *   necessarily implemented): IssueDetailPage gets a small "Part of a
 *   milestone" indicator below, since it already has the single Bounty
 *   object this field now lives on — no new fetch needed. MilestonesPage
 *   cross-linking to member bounties is recommended *against* for this
 *   PR: Milestone only carries aggregate issueCount/completedCount
 *   numbers today, and listing member bounties would need either a new
 *   backend endpoint (bounties filtered by milestoneId) or fetching every
 *   bounty on a funding-overview page just to filter client-side —
 *   real new scope, not a natural extension of restoring this mapping.
