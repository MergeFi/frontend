/**
 * Build-time validation for this app's `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables (#26).
 *
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are inlined into the client bundle by Next.js at
 * build time, not read at runtime — so a misconfiguration can't be caught
 * or fixed after the fact the way a server-only env var could be. This
 * module's exports are pure and side-effect-free (they take a raw value in
 * and return a validated one out, or throw); `next.config.ts` is what
 * actually calls them at module-evaluation time so an invalid value aborts
 * `next build`/`next dev`/`next start` immediately, before anything else
 * runs. `config.ts` calls the same functions so every other consumer in
 * the app also gets the validated values, not a second, divergent check.

 * be a production build, or the reverse), which fails confusingly at the
 * Soroban contract layer at best. Network selection is too consequential
 * to guess a default for, so an unset or misspelled value fails the build
 * instead of silently picking one.
