  {
    question: "What happens if an issue never gets resolved?",

      "Sponsors can refund an unresolved bounty at any time before it's claimed, or after its deadline passes. The escrow contract returns the full amount to the sponsor's wallet.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a bounty be split between multiple contributors?",

      "Yes. Maintainers can define a team split by percentage (for example 40% frontend, 40% backend, 20% testing), and the contract distributes the payout accordingly the moment the work is merged.",

  {

    question: "Do I need a Stellar wallet to participate?",
